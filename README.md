# Coding Challenges ðŸ§ 

I solve coding problems for fun. This repo is where I drop my solutions â€” from LeetCode, CodeSignal, and anywhere else I feel like practicing.

## Structure
Problems are organized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.  
Each file is named `[problem_number]_[problem_name].py`.

## Example:
- `easy/1_merge_strings_alternately.py`
